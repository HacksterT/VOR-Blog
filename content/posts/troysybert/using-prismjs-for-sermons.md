As we develop the Voice of Repentance blog, we're implementing several technical features to make our sermon content more engaging, accessible, and educational. One of these features is the integration of Prism.js, a powerful syntax highlighting tool that we've adapted for biblical content.

## Why We're Using Prism.js

While Prism.js was originally designed for displaying code snippets, we've found it to be incredibly useful for presenting:

- Biblical passages with verse highlighting
- Original language texts (Hebrew, Greek)
- Theological concept structures
- Important terms and their definitions

## Highlighting Specific Verses

When discussing a passage, we can highlight specific verses to draw attention to key points:

```bible
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, 
  and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." 
  And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
```

Notice how verses 2, 3, and 5 are highlighted, making it easier to focus on these specific parts of the passage.

## Displaying Original Languages

For deeper study, we can include the original Hebrew or Greek text:

```hebrew
בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ
```

```greek
Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.
```

The language is clearly indicated at the top of each block, helping readers understand what they're looking at.

## Automatic Linking of References

Biblical references like John 3:16 or Romans 8:28 can be automatically converted into links to Bible study resources. Similarly, URLs to additional resources will be automatically detected and made clickable.

## Highlighting Theological Concepts

When explaining complex theological concepts, we can use syntax highlighting to make the structure clearer:

```theology
Salvation {
  Grace: "unmerited favor of God"
  Faith: "trust in Christ's finished work"
  Works: {
    Result: "of salvation"
    Not: "cause of salvation"
  }
}
```

## Command Line Examples for Bible Study Tools

We can even show how to use Bible study software with command-line examples:

```powershell
# Search for all occurrences of "love" in 1 Corinthians 13
bible-search "love" --book "1 Corinthians" --chapter 13

# Compare translations of John 3:16
bible-compare "John 3:16" --translations "KJV,NIV,ESV,NASB"
```

## Our Implementation Process

For the Voice of Repentance blog, we've configured Prism.js with the following plugins:

1. **line-highlight** - For highlighting specific verses
2. **show-language** - To clearly indicate different languages
3. **autolinker** - To automatically create links for references
4. **match-braces** - To show structure in theological concepts
5. **highlight-keywords** - To emphasize important terms

## Future Enhancements

As we continue to develop our blog, we plan to:

1. Create custom language definitions for biblical texts
2. Develop a verse reference shortcode for Hugo
3. Integrate with Bible API services for dynamic content
4. Add interactive concordance features

## Conclusion

By adapting tools like Prism.js for biblical content, we're making our sermon materials more engaging and educational. This is just one example of how we're using modern web technologies to enhance the ministry of Voice of Repentance.

We hope this demonstration helps you understand how we're structuring our content and why. In future posts, we'll explore more aspects of our technical implementation and how they serve our ministry goals.
