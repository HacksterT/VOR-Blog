Repentance is a journey of awareness and enlightenment. It is an awareness of your creation. Who are you in relation to the world around you? It is an understanding of who you are followed by a recognition of that awareness.

When Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, it necessitated us realizing that while we were made in God's image, we were of this world. We were created from the dust of the earth. And to the dust we will return. God breathed life into us as a species of humans. And while we were made in His image, we are not God. The earthly nature of our being must be tamed. We need a vehicle to keep that nature in check. Without it in check, we become like Cain...not just capable of evil but acting on that capability.

Gen 4:7...our actions matter. Our nature is waiting to control us. It is ever present as long as we are of the dust of the earth. God asks Cain is he wishes to be the master of his sin or allow it to be his master.

When the knowledge of good and evil were released, the need to recognize and become aware of who we are was also born. The need to master our nature through recognizing who created us and how we relate to our creator. It is this awareness and submission that allows us to walk in grace. While we can never shed the mortal blanket that envelopes us, we can walk in His grace while we master the sinful nature that results from being made of the dust of the earth.

Self preservation and survival are intrinsic to our nature. Mortality and a finite existence lead to a tendency for self-preservation. It is a drive that allows us to perpetuate our existence. By nature, we are self-centered because we want to survive. It is the core of our mortal existence. But our mortal existence is a finite shell for who we really are when we are part of His kingdom. It is the real world beyond this finite world. It is an existence of immortality as we become one with the one who created us. But we must realize who we are while on earth. We must realize the nature of our mortality. We must realize it leads to death. That death is not just of our mortal bodies but the very spirit inside us. We must turn from our very nature by realizing our Creator and that He has called us beyond this life. We must understand the works of the flesh are our vey nature. We must lead a life that turns from the things that feed that nature. We must realize that He is our preservation and not ourself. This is an enlightenment of who we really are and who we will become.

We must understand and learn to recognize the manifestation of our very nature...it is sin. The mastery of that sinful nature is not that we just follow a set of rules. But we must realize who we are and that we are born of this Earth. To master our sin is to recognize and submit to our Creator. It is to be enveloped by grace which was enabled by the sacrifice of Jesus. This allows our very nature to become transformed...to have His laws in our hearts. We must choose to lead a life of repentance allowing His nature to grow in our hearts. Repentance is a journey through life as we submit our very earthly nature so it can be usurped with His ways.
