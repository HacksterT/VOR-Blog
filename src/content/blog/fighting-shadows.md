Fighting Shadows is a worship anthem born out of real pain, real struggle, and real grace. It was written for anyone who's ever looked in the mirror and felt like they were losing the fight—to addiction, shame, fear, or regret.

This song is personal as it was inspired by the loss of my brother, whose life and struggle shaped the direction of my own. It's also dedicated to the men and women I've met through Recovery Soldiers Ministry—people fighting battles most can't see, yet rising each day to fight again. And finally, it is for that one...you...let God be a part of your life. Stop fighting your shadows.

In this song, the "shadows" represent everything we wrestle with in the silence—our past, our guilt, our unspoken pain. But behind it all is a light that never leaves: the cross. It the hope that Christ gives and it is declaring a different ending to our story.

There's a line in the song that says:
> "What once was shame is now Your song."

That's not just a lyric. That's a testimony. Because when God gets involved, our greatest failures can become the very stage for His glory.

This is the standalone music version of Fighting Shadows. If you want to hear more of the story behind the benches, the tree, and the testimony—you can find it in the Intro+ version on my channel.

But for now, let this song speak to your spirit. If you're in a fight, you're not alone. There's still hope. God is still reaching—and His grace is still enough.
