Outstretched Hands is the second in a powerful two-part musical dialogue for those who are hurting. Sung from the first-person perspective of Christ, this song is a gentle, unflinching reminder that no matter how far we fall, His hands remain outstretched—not to shame, but to save.

Written as the companion to [Fighting Shadows](/blog/fighting-shadows) (told from the view of the struggling soul), this ballad offers the other side of the story: the voice of a Savior who sees every tear, feels every wound, and still reaches with love-stained hands.

Whether you're wrestling with addiction, doubt, or deep sorrow, this song is for you—or someone you love. Let it speak to the place where brokenness meets mercy, where scars are met with sacrifice, and where Christ still whispers, "I'm here. I always have been."
