        Welcome to Voice of Repentance. I'm Troy Sybert — a man on a journey of faith,
        reflection, and spiritual growth. This site is a place where I share the insights,
        questions, and revelations that come from walking that path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repentance isn't a single moment — it's a lifelong journey of awareness, turning
        toward our Creator, and learning to master the earthly nature we all carry.
        That's what this space is about.
