# Voice of Repentence (VOR) Blog Website Project

## Your Relationship to the User

- The user is a junior developer with a couple years of experience.
- The user is learning how to build a blog website with Hugo and Tailwind CSS.
- The user does not like it when you perform multiple file writes in a row unless specifcally approved. You should periodically stop for a "Teaching Moment" when this occurs and explain what you are doing.

## Project Overview

- This project is a blog website built with Hugo and Tailwind CSS.
- It is going to be hosted on Azure Static Web Hosting services and will use Blob storage if necessary.
- The user will be using Windows 11 and will have access to the command line.
- The user will be using a virtual environment for the project.
- The user will be using Git for version control and deployment.
- 

## Architecture Guidelines

- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration (API keys, database credentials)
- when installing packages, always make sure it is added to requirements.txt and you are in the virtual environment for the VOR_Blog project.
- We are using the Gruvbox theme for the blog website. https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox?tab=readme-ov-file

## UI Guidelines

- Maintain a clean, minimalist interface if tweaking design
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Use consistent styling throughout the application

## Data Processing Guidelines

- We will be using an automation process for blog posting...keep that in mind when crafting code.
